          <p className="pitta-text">
            While how to balance pitta dosha is the question that needs immediate attention, knowing about what causes pitta imbalance in the body is equally important. There are a lot of factors that contribute towards accumulation of pitta dosha or pitta imbalance. Some of the most notable among them are:
          </p>
          <ul className="pitta-list">
            <li>Exposure to pitta opposing or provoking diet</li>
            <li>Excessive consumption of preservatives</li>
            <li>Exposure to the sun</li>
            <li>Exposure to too many chemicals</li>
            <li>Emotional or physical stress</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 className="pitta-subheader">How to Balance Pitta Dosha—Easy Lifestyle Tips</h2>
          <p className="pitta-text">
            One of the foundational principles of Ayurveda is that “like increases like,” and opposites balance. Therefore, because Pitta dosha is hot, sharp, and oily in nature, it benefits from things that are cooling and soothing. Some of the easiest ways to restore balance to Pitta include:
          </p>
          <ul className="pitta-list">
            <li>Engaging in cooling activities like swimming or strolling in nature (but not under the hot sun).</li>
            <li>Doing light-hearted things like spending time with loved ones and children.</li>
            <li>Following a Pitta dosha-balancing diet, favoring cooling, heavy, dry foods and sweet, bitter, and astringent tastes while avoiding hot, sour, salty, and spicy foods.</li>
            <li>Keeping cool and avoiding hot temperatures, food, and spicy meals.</li>
            <li>Bringing balance to your daily routine by avoiding overworking and practicing moderation.</li>
            <li>Allowing for uplifting leisure time every day.</li>
            <li>Eating three satisfying meals per day at about the same time each day.</li>
            <li>Ensuring your largest meal of the day takes place at noon, when your digestive fire is strongest.</li>
            <li>Practicing daily abhyanga (self-massage with warm oil), using cooling oils such as coconut.</li>
            <li>Reducing mental stress with meditation, such as the Transcendental Meditation® program.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 className="pitta-subheader">Pitta Dosha Diet Guidelines & Recipes</h2>
          <p className="pitta-text">
            In Ayurveda, food is medicine. A Pitta-pacifying diet will go a long way toward cooling and soothing fiery Pitta dosha. Aim to eat three meals at the same times each day: morning, noon, and evening—and try not to skip meals (which can fan the flames of Pitta’s digestive fire and lead to frustration, irritability, acid stomach, and other unpleasant issues). Ideally, you’ll feel hungry by the next meal, but not ravenous.
          </p>
          <p className="pitta-text">
            It’s okay to snack a bit between meals, so long as it doesn’t dampen the feeling of hunger by your next meal. Try to eat in a quiet, relaxing environment to avoid over-stimulation. Last, but definitely not least, whenever possible favor organically grown foods and avoid genetically modified foods (GMOs).

          <h2 className="pitta-subheader">Yoga for Pitta Dosha</h2>
          <p className="pitta-text">
            As a sister science of Ayurveda, Yoga is an excellent exercise and spiritual practice to incorporate in your daily routine for balancing your individual constitution. Although many yoga poses or asanas are beneficial to each of the doshas, the greatest benefit for balancing your dosha comes from your approach and the way you practice the pose.
          </p>
          <h3 className="pitta-subheader">Pitta Yoga Tips</h3>
          <p className="pitta-text">
            A yoga practice for a pitta individual should encourage compassion, acceptance, relaxed effort, and be cooling in nature. Pittas can cultivate this by following some basic guidelines:
          </p>
          <ul className="pitta-list">
            <li>Have fun in your poses. Do not take yourself or your pose too seriously.</li>
            <li>Enjoy movement in your poses.</li>
            <li>Soften your gaze downward, at the horizon or even practice with your eyes closed.</li>
            <li>Allow freedom and creativity in your practice. Change it up. Avoid sticking to one style or series of poses.</li>
            <li>Practice in a moderately cool space. You do not want to get cold, but pittas should avoid practicing in extremely heated spaces.</li>
            <li>Focus on the yoga experience in your body, not your brain.</li>
            <li>Work at 80% effort.</li>
            <li>Avoid being judgmental and critical of yourself.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have plenty of practice space.</li>
            <li>Remind yourself that yoga is not a competition.</li>
            <li>Focus on your exhalation and use it to let go and release any built-up anger, frustration, or stress.</li>
            <li>Be aware of your breath in your back body.</li>
            <li>Practice plenty of twists and side body openers.</li>
            <li>Notice the position of your ribs; draw them back into your body.</li>
            <li>Benefit from practicing at a moderate pace.</li>
            <li>Remind yourself that less is more!</li>
          </ul>
